# Aleksey Nemiro's Knowledge Base

:::warning
This document has been translated using machine translation without human review.
:::

Hello! My name is Aleksey Nemiro and this is my knowledge base.

I am a Full Stack .NET (C#) and TypeScript developer with a focus on frontend.

My work periodically touches on many different areas, and this knowledge base was created to help me remember what I use or have used in my activities.

The knowledge base does not contain detailed information, but consists only of brief summaries and notes that help achieve a specific result or draw certain conclusions.

From time to time, I fill the knowledge base with my original entries in Russian, without the use of generative models (LLM).

Previously, my knowledge base was in English, but with the development of artificial intelligence technologies, I see no point in maintaining a foreign language for me.
It is more convenient for me to write and read in Russian. Nevertheless, I use artificial intelligence to automatically translate my original entries into English to reach an English-speaking audience.

If this site is useful to you, I would appreciate a star.
