This document contains information to help you dive into the world of local large language models (LLM).

* [x] **[GPT4All](gpt4all)** - a decent solution to start getting familiar with large language models (LLM). Uses local models and works on weak hardware. Among other things, it allows for easy integration of your own data.
* [x] **[LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)** - an advanced tool for working with large language models.
* [x] **[llama.cpp](llama-cpp)** - an excellent solution for programmatic integration with LLM.
* [x] **[FlowiseAI](flowise)** - visual programming for large language models (LLM). A good start for those unfamiliar with Python or programming in general. Allows the use of both local and cloud models.
* [x] **Embedding & RAG** - key terms that will help you understand how to integrate your own content into an LLM.
* [x] **Fine-Tuning** - an approach for creating your own models based on existing ones. Requires significant technical, human, and financial resources.
