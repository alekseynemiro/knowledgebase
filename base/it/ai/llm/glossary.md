* Parameters - the variables that the model learns during training.
* Transfer Learning - training a model based on previous experience.
* Token (code) - the basic unit of input and output in a language model. Token typically represent word, subword, or character.
* Quantization - in language models, this is the process of limiting the rounding of numbers to reduce the amount of RAM consumed.
  The lower the value, the faster the work, but the less accurate the result.
* Weight - numerical coefficients describing the work of each neuron in the network.
