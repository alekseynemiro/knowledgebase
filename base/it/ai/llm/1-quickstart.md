# Quickstart

*Last Updated: 2025-01-25*

This document contains information to help you dive into the world of machine learning.

* [x] [GPT4All](gpt4all) - great solution for getting started with local large language models (LLMs), including the easy ability to use your own datasets.
* [x] [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) - a slightly more complex solution, not bad as a next step in getting to know LLMs.
* [x] [llama.cpp](llama.cpp) - great solution to start integrating LLMs (application development, automation, sharing).
* [x] [FlowiseAI](flowise) - visual programming of LLMs, for those who are not familiar with Python.
* [x] Embedding & RAG - keywords to help you integrate your own content into LLMs.
* [x] Fine-Tuning - additional training of LLMs, essentially a technology for creating your own models based on existing ones. Requires a large amount of technical, human, and financial resources.
