# Aleksey Nemiro's knowledge base

Hello everyone! My name is Aleksey Nemiro and you are in my knowledge base.

I am a Full Stack Developer focusing on .NET (C#) and TypeScript.

My activities periodically touch on many different areas, and this knowledge base of meanings was created to help me remember what I use or have once used in my activities.

You won't find any detailed information about anything here. There are only superficial excerpts on individual issues.

However, if you find this site useful, I would appreciate it if you could give it a star.
